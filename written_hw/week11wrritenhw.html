    <ul>
        <li>1. What is Express in Node.js and why is it used?</li>
        <li>Express is a web framework within Node. It also acts as the library for other open-source frameworks that have been built in node. Express allows us to view our code without serving it to the web and also provides some functionality that Node lacks out of the box because it is browser-based.</li>
        <li>2. How does Mongoose help in using MongoDB with Node.js?</li>
        <li>Mongoose is basically training wheels for connecting MongoDB with Node. It limits what aspects of the MongoDB API we can use but allows us to more easily access the parts that we need to use. </li>
        <li>3. Can you explain the role of Mongoose in managing relationships between data?</li>
        <li>Mongoose works with the Mongo Driver and lets us select which aspects of the API we want our program to work with. This allows us to streamline our use of the API and prevents accidental errors from occurring with unused parts interfering with the code we are trying to use</li>
        <li>4. What is a software design pattern? Give an example.</li>
        <li>A software design template is a template for how to deal with a common software issue. They are proven solutions to common problems. One example is a prototype that is replicable across many instances</li>
        <li>5. Can you explain the MVC architecture in detail?</li>
        <li>MVC is a division of the logic tree into three parts that control the code by doing separate functionalities. 
            The Model in MVc is the data representation as well as the rules that govern it. This is the “backend” of our app in essence.
            The View is what is displayed on the browser when accessing the specified route. One example of view files is JSX. 
            The Controller is the UI, or what allows the user of the page to interact with the displayed page</li>
        <li>6. What roles do Model, View, and Controller play in the MVC architecture?</li>
        <li>The Model is the data representation as well as the rules that govern it. This is the “backend” of our app in essence.
            The View is what is displayed on the browser when accessing the specified route. One example of view files is JSX. 
            The Controller is the UI, or what allows the user of the page to interact with the displayed page</li>
        <li>7. Define Latency and Throughput in the context of APIs</li>
        <li>Latency is the time delay it takes for data to transfer from the backend after the request has been made. Throughput is how much data can be transferred in a time period, usually tested around common time increments like 60 seconds. Having low latency and a high Throughpoint is a sign of a good API</li>
        <li>8. Why is it important to minimize latency and maximize throughput in APIs?</li>
        <li>With less delay and faster package transfers the User Experience is enhanced.</li>
        <li>9. What is Authentication in terms of web development?</li>
        <li>Authentication is the process of verifying that a users credentials match the which are stored in the server in order to allow secure access to profiles and information</li>
        <li>10. How does the authorization process start?</li>
        <li>It starts when the credentials presented are deemed valid</li>
        <li>11. What is express.static used for in Express?</li>
        <li>It is a middleware function that serves static files</li>
        <li>12. Can you give an example of serving static files using express.static?</li>
        <li>It can serve as an unchanging piece of the code such as a .jpg company logo that would appear on a page.</li>
        <li>13. What is Jest and why is it used?</li>
        <li>Jest is a testing framework focused on simple Javascript testing.</li>
        <li>14. How can Supertest be helpful when working with Jest?</li>
        <li>Supertest is a higher-end testing program than Jest. That means we can run more complex either UI or automatic tests within it. Increasing the rigor of the testing allows us to have more stable programs that are more prepared for the challenges that they will face when being put to use by the general public or the client it was created for. </li>
        <li>15. Can you describe how manual and automated tests are executed?</li>
        <li>Manual tests are done by having a user enter data via the UI and test to see that it matches. Automated tests have preset arguments, values, or whatever else is being tested preset by the developer in the test routes. In essence it is a manual test is fluid whereas automated tests are static after they have been served.</li>
        <li>16. What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing?</li>
        <li>Unit tests focus on individual pieces of the program like a function or method. Integration tests check whether multiple components work together properly to achieve a larger action. And End-to-end tests if a program works in an environment made to mimic its full deployment.</li>
        <li>17. Can you provide examples of functional, regression, smoke, and performance tests?</li>
        <li>Functional tests- unit tests that check methods are a form of functional tests. 
            Regression tests- running a test in 2016 to make sure that your var variables are still functioning correctly after the 2015 code drop. 
            Smoke testing- running an automated or manual test on Day 0 to ensure that a new build is stable.
            Performance test- runs on a program to check to see if it can handle different load sizes put on the program. For example testing servers before the release of a popular game to make sure it doesn't crash when users get their hands on it.</li>
        <li>18. What is meant by positive testing and negative testing in a functional testing context?</li>
        <li>Positive means to check does it work when it should. And negative tests to make sure things fail correctly, i.e. putting in a ba password gives you an error message saying the wrong password instead of redirecting you back to the home page or some other unintended action.</li>
        <li>19. How does load testing assess the behavior of software?</li>
        <li>Load testing asses how software holds up under heavy usage. I.e. can 1000 people use the login route simultaneously? Does it slow down? Or does it stay the same? </li>
        <li>20. What aspects does usability testing assess in a software application?</li>
        <li>How a user actually interacts with the website. People are completely unpredictable and we don't know how they will actually use something until it is in the hands of the user. This testing gives them some insight into that</li>
        <li>21. Why is security testing so crucual in a software development life cycle?</li>
        <li>Security testing is essential to assure that user data remains safe from bad actors. Many governments also have laws that regulate consumer data management and must therefore be taken extremely seriously</li>
        <li>22. Can you explain what compatibility testing is?</li>
        <li>Compatibility testing is a form of testing that checks to see if a given program can work within a variety of different browsers/OS/etc. which it would operate within.</li>
        <li>23. What is the aim of recovery testing and why is it important? </li>
        <li>It is when we force a program to fail to see how well it can recover and what data and methods maintain integrity throughout the crash. It is important as all things daily sometimes and you need to see how your app reacts when placed in that situation. Microsoft Word’s auto recover is a feature that shows adaptations for recovery testing in use.</li>
        <li>24. What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and who typically performs it?</li>
        <li>The final testing stage, is when users and clients use the product and see if it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
